Inverse Ising problem in continuous time.

This files contain the code for solving the Ising model with asymmetric couplings in continuous time. 
It includes code for obtaining the maximum likelihood estimation, for the L1 penalized likelihood estimator and a variational Bayes algorithm to obtain an approximate posterior over the couplings.
